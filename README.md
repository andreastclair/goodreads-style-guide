Goodreads is a social site for readers and authors to find and share books that they love. With a Goodreads account, a user can build personal libraries with multiple shelves, track their reading progress, and find and recommend other titles to and from their friends.  

##Challenges  

The current Goodreads site is too cluttered. There is a lack of overall hierarchy which makes navigation confusing. With all of the site's features displayed, it's difficult for the user to tell what's the most important and where their attention should go first. There is no clear difference in type treatment for links.   

##Goals  

- Define hierarchy on all pages.
- Make the site easier to navigate.
- Reduce clutter.  

##Solutions  

- Use color and font-sizes to define hierarchy.
- Use the Gestalt principles to group like elements together, making the site easier to navigate.
- Combine elements into dropdown menus.
- Give a history of what you're re/designing. 
- Call out competitors as challenges.
- Write out the game plan. How are you going to make this better?
- Do a "this not that" visual list to help show personality.
- Talk about the brand. Is there a mascot? What's the theme? (Achievements)
